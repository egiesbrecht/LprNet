## About
LprNet uses the [prNet-project](https://github.com/egiesbrecht/prNet) to create a simple possibility to analyze the German language. The goal of this project is to test out how far pattern recognition can go with language-like constructs.

## The integration of [prNet](#https://github.com/egiesbrecht/prNet)
This project isn't directly a fork nor uses an upstream repository. Instead it just uses a local copy of prNet's files. I decided to go this way because some small changes were needed that wouldn't make sense to push into the original repo. These changes don't effect the core functionality but rather some practical use cases.

## The database
I've used parts of the databases of the [Morphy-Project](https://euralex.org/elx_proceedings/Euralex2000/071_Wolfgang%20LEZIUS_Software%20Demonstration_Morphy%20German%20Morphology,%20Part-of-Speech%20Tagging%20and%20Applications.pdf) and [Open-Thesaurus](https://www.openthesaurus.de) to create simple dictionary and associations tables into a SQLite database. Those are only used intern in the project to create objects which contain all necassary information to analyze whole articles and similar sorts of texts.
The tables *dictionary*, *associations* and *texte* are required to run the program, all other tables will automaticly be created when they are needed. The here given sample also contains examples, created by a single run of the *src/demo/language/TranslateTexts.java* class.

## How it works
All additions to [prNet](#https://github.com/egiesbrecht/prNet) are in the *language*-package. It implements a structure to represent language based on object which represent grammar, words and texts. Such a text-object can be created from a simple text file with help of the [database](#The-database). The *LanguagePatternUsage*-class automates some processes of the *PatternUsage*-class and implements them directly for text-objects.<br>
The *SQLlanguageOperations*-class provides all methods needed to save those patterns and texts in the database and use them for later calculations.
